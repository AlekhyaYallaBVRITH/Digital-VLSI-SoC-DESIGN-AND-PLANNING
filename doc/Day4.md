# üïí Delay Tables in Digital VLSI

Delay tables are fundamental in timing characterization of standard cells, enabling accurate modeling of delay and transition time for use in Static Timing Analysis (STA).

---

## üîç What Are Delay Tables?

Delay tables model how long a gate takes to respond to changing inputs and how fast its output transitions. These delays depend on:
- **Input transition (slew)**
- **Output load (capacitance)**

They are extracted during **standard cell characterization** and stored in **Liberty (.lib)** format.

## üß† Types of Delay Tables

| Table Type            | Description                                                  | Liberty Syntax        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Cell Delay Tables** | Propagation delay (input ‚Üí output)                          | `cell_rise`, `cell_fall` |
| **Transition Tables** | Output slew based on input slew and load                    | `rise_transition`, `fall_transition` |

## üì¶ Sample Liberty Format

```liberty
cell_rise (delay_template_1x1) {
    index_1 ("0.01");  // input transition (slew)
    index_2 ("0.01");  // output load (capacitance)
    values ("0.035");  // delay value in ns
}
rise_transition (delay_template_1x1) {
    index_1 ("0.01");
    index_2 ("0.01");
    values ("0.012");  // transition time in ns
}

# ‚è∞ Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) and Signal Integrity

## Overview
Clock tree synthesis (CTS) is a critical step in the digital backend flow. It ensures the clock signal reaches all sequential elements (like flip-flops) with minimal skew and maximum signal integrity. TritonCTS (used in OpenROAD/OpenLANE flows) supports H-tree-based routing with buffers to balance delays and improve performance.

---

## üß© Naive Clock Routing and Skew

Initially, a simple clock net might connect directly to all flip-flops.

- Example: `clk1` connects to FF1 & FF2 of Stage 1, FF1 of Stage 3, and FF2 of Stage 4.
- Problem: Wire lengths vary ‚Üí causes **clock skew**:  
  `Skew = t2 - t1 ‚â† 0 ps`

This leads to race conditions, setup/hold violations, and unreliable timing.

---

## üå≥ Optimized Clock Tree (H-Tree Strategy)

To minimize skew:
- Clock root is placed at a **central location**
- Clock branches are **balanced symmetrically** (H-tree topology)
- Ensures clock signal reaches endpoints simultaneously

Same strategy applies to `clk2` and all branches.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Clock Tree Buffering (Repeaters)

Due to RC effects in long clock routes:
- Signal degrades
- Input and output waveforms do not match

### Solution: Buffer Insertion
- Insert **clock buffers/repeaters** to restore signal strength
- Clock buffers are sized for **equal rise/fall times**
- Multiple repeaters may be inserted to maintain waveform fidelity

---

## ‚ö° Signal Integrity: Crosstalk and Shielding

### Crosstalk Issue
- Adjacent nets (aggressors) can **induce noise** on the clock net (victim)
- Caused by **coupling capacitance**
- Results in **glitches**, **delta delay**, and increased **skew**

### üî∞ Shielding the Clock Net
- Place grounded/VDD wires between aggressor and victim
- These **non-switching wires** act as shields
- Reduce capacitive coupling and protect clock waveform

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Without shielding:
> - Noise impacts timing
> - Makes skew non-zero
> - Increases risk of functional failure

| Buffer Insertion  | Mitigate RC delay and waveform loss  |
| Shielding         | Protect against crosstalk interference|
